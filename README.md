üöÄ Interactive Digital Portfolio
A dynamic, fully responsive personal portfolio website built exclusively with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to showcase skills, projects, and interactive front-end development capabilities.

üåü Project Overview
This project was developed as a Capstone Submission for the IBM Skillbuild Edunet program.

The goal was to move beyond the limitations of a traditional, static resume by creating a live, interactive platform that directly demonstrates proficiency in core web technologies and modern UI/UX design.

Problem Statement
Many developers struggle to present their practical skills (like responsiveness, complex animations, and interactive design) effectively in a static document. This project solves that by providing a highly engaging, custom-coded platform to visually communicate technical abilities.

Key Features Implemented
Smooth Navigation: Fixed header and smooth scrolling behavior between sections.
Dynamic Typing Effect: A custom JavaScript function to cycle and type out professional roles on the Home screen.
High-Performance Animations: Image floating effects implemented using requestAnimationFrame.
Responsive Design: Full adaptability across mobile, tablet, and desktop views using CSS Media Queries.
Skills Visualization: Animated progress bars triggered when the section scrolls into view using the Intersection Observer API.
Interactive Feedback: Custom ripple effect on the Contact button.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
This project strictly adheres to the core front-end technology requirement, using no external frameworks or libraries beyond standard helper utilities.

HTML5: Semantic structure and content organization.

CSS3: Custom styling, responsiveness (Flexbox/Grid), and animation keyframes.

JavaScript : All logic for interactivity, scrolling, animations, and user experience.
